enum DamageTypes {
	Base,
	Heat,
	Cold,
	Electricity,
	Psychic,
	True ## Ignores resistance.
}

## Easy accessor for returning the resistance for damage types.
static var damage_to_res_map: Dictionary = {
	DamageTypes.Base: StatTypes.Defense,
	DamageTypes.Heat: StatTypes.HeatRes,
	DamageTypes.Cold: StatTypes.ColdRes,
	DamageTypes.Electricity: StatTypes.ElectricityRes,
	DamageTypes.Psychic: StatTypes.PsychicRes
}

## Wrapper for getting the attributes.
static var attributes: Array[StatTypes]:
	get: return [StatTypes.Vitality, StatTypes.Technique, StatTypes.Will]
